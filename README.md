1.Cencus data for  
2007-11 and 2011-15 (one record per tract)

2.Restrict data in 2011 to all tracts with lower than median income

3. Creating a gentrification measure;
- growth in percentage of adults with college degrees

4. Visualize Cencus data

5. Visualize retailers for 2011 and 2015 (for given tracts in subsetted cencus data)

6. Analysis;

Compare (2011 vs 2015) count of tobacco retailers across two groups-
- tracts that gentrified 
- tracts that did not gentrify
***for our data - (tracts with lower than median income in 2011)

Outcome;
Number of tobacco retailers

Variable of interest;
Gentrification (defined as growth in percentage of adults with college degrees)


Covariates;

-mean income 
-mean rent 
-baseline percentage of adults with college degrees
-baseline borough of residence and distances from midtown Manhattan
and from the nearest subway station


Limitations;

Unable to distinguish new residents from long-term residents during the gentrification period because of
the cross-sectional nature of the data.

A lack of consensus around the definition of gentrification

Tobacco retailers data set may underestimate prevalence as it does not contain information for unlicensed shops
